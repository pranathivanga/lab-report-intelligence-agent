🧠 LAB REPORT INTELLIGENCE AGENT
🚨 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Lab reports contain complex medical terminology and numerical values that are difficult for non-medical users to understand. This often causes confusion, anxiety, and misinterpretation of personal health data.

💡 OUR SOLUTION

Lab Report Intelligence Agent converts raw lab reports into structured, plain-language insights that help users understand their health data clearly — without providing medical diagnosis.

✨ UNIQUE INNOVATION

We don’t just display lab values.
We structure understanding by:

Providing a high-level summary first

Categorizing results as normal, low, or high

Explaining values in simple language

Maintaining a strictly non-diagnostic, patient-safe design

Our focus is health literacy, not diagnosis.
